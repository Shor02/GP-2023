# Description of the project
I wanted to make something that potentially could practically help a game developer, in this case a sound test for a hypothetical Cyberwave 8-bit game.
# Instructions for use
Left click on a button, and it plays the corresponding sound that it is named.
# How it works
Basically there is one prefab button, with a Audio Stream Player attached as a child node. The audio stream is a preinstalled .wav file in the project. I duplicated the inital button 14 times and edited each child AudioStreamPlayer's audio stream to a new source, which allowed new audio to be played when the button is hit
# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I had attempted numerous different ways to go about this assignment, including an earlier scrapped idea involving generative piano notes which I unfortunately could not get to work. I also tried generating buttons based on the contents of an array but I couldnt get that to work properly. I am proud of this assignment though, as I learned alot about how Godot works, besides audio in Godot I learned alot about setting up a project, how different scenes function aswell as GDscripting in general.
